## About

Vesta is a decentralized team productivity platform designed to revolutionize the way teams communicate, collaborate, and boost their efficiency.

## Key Features

### Decentralized Communication

## Motivation

In today's fast-paced world, effective communication and collaboration are the cornerstones of successful teams. As technology evolves, so do the challenges faced by teams striving to maximize their productivity.
